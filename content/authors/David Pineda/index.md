I am an assistant professor and Ramón y Cajal fellow at the philosophy department of the Universitat de Barcelona. Before that, I was a member of Bence Nanay’s research group at UAntwerpen, and even before that I did research at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and The Graduate Center, CUNY.

Most of what I do is related in some way to the question of what makes certain entities be about, mean, or represent others.
